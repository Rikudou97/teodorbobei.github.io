This project is a Weather App. I used HTML, Javascript and CSS for it, and the weather information is provided by a Open Weather API. You type in the name of the city and the weather information updates.
The App is rudimental for the moment. In the future I'll implement a 'more' button, that will show more weather information (UV index, Sunrise, Sunset, etc...). The button already exists but is not implemented yet. 
Also, I'll implement geolocation.
